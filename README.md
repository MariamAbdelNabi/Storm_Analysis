# Damage Analysis on Natural Disasters based on NOAAâ€™s Storm Database
The objective of this project is to investigate U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database, to find which type of event has the greatest impact on population health, and poses the most severe economic consequences. We begin this analysis with loading data, and then extracting useful columns to form a clean dataset ready for further analysis. Then, we use aggregate() function to find the average fatalities, injuries, property damage, crop damage, and total damages by types of events, and extract the highest 5 types of events in each damage categories. Finally, we use the extracted top-5 data frames to plot barplots to communicate our findings.
